The json files here are generated by the script csv2json.sh in ../../scripts.
That script has two output modes--optimized and non-optimized. The optimized 
json output is about 60% the size of the non-optimized.

If you're updating the .csv data in this directory, you will need to re-generate
the json files; to do so, run this command in this directory:

        ../../scripts/csv2json.sh -o
